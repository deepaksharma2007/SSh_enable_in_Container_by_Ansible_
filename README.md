# ğŸ”° Configure Webserver Inside Container By AnsibleğŸ”°

### Description 

By default docker container is isolated. So we cannot ssh the conainer. Ansible uses the ssh way to login container. So I create a docker image that has ssh enabled. So we can directly launch container and configure apache webserver within the container by Ansible Tool.

### Steps

ğŸ”¹ Ansible PlayBook Configure Docker

ğŸ”¹ Start and enable Docker services

ğŸ”¹ Pull the docker image (deepak2007/centos_ssh) from the Docker Hub
